                <h3>PHASE 1: DISCOVERY & RESEARCH</h3>
                <h4>USER SURVEY</h4>
                <p>I started the process with a survey to get to know the users and competitors.
                  I wanted to know what kind of information they save, how often,
                  what devices they use to perform these tasks, and specifically, the most important features they use.
                  The goal is to understand what makes them prefer a specific competitor?</p>

                          <p>Dropbox is another strong competitor. Their dashboard navigation changes based on what the users clicked.
                            This caused confusion. It is a platform known for syncing files from multiple devices rather than for creating new contents.</p>

                                  The differentiator of virtBox is its organization feature, which I found an opportunity to highlight in the dashboard navigation pane.

                                  <p>The wireframes were then used to performed usability tests: 1 in-person, and 2 remotes.
                                    This helped me see how users interact with the sketches without visual clues.</p>
                                    <p>Users were asked to perform the followings:</p>

                                        <p>Since the product is created for online learners, I want to establish a bright, clean, and motivative environment.
                                          The name virtBox is the combination of academic growth and the concept of online storage.
                                          Virt is short for virtual, representing the virtual workspace for users. Virt in French represents the color green and green represent growth.
                                          When users use virtBox for their online learning experience, they are growing academically. Box represents a platform to store all files in one place.
                                          virtBox’s logo combines the letter”B” sideways inside a laptop. The internal “B” is a derivative of earlier sketches of a virtual reality glasses.</p>

                                            Further research shows blue is the most widely liked color.
                                            I decided to use blue, but also wanted to differentiate my product from the competitors, thus, indigo was chosen.
                                            Indigo was paired with a blue-gray color at different opacity to create variety.
                                            All combinations passed the WCAG AA and WCAG AAA test with accessibility for those with color blindness. </p>

                                                <p>The 3rd iteration then used to perform another usability tests: 2 in-person and 1 remote test.
                                                  Overall, participants did not have trouble sorting content and identifying file types.
                                                  Major improvements need to be fixed are with Invision. Many screens were not displaying correctly.
                                                  Otherwise, participants liked virtBox features; especially the color-coded feature.
                                                  They were also excited to have a semi-final product that they can experience compared to the clickable wireframes.</p>

                                                    <li>Popup windows need to pop up correctly. Blur out the background.</li>
                                                    <li>Consistent sort by content format.</li>
                                                    <li>“Create new file” options need to link to the correct destinations.</li>

                                                  <p>This iteration utilized the semi-final product with improvements made based on the feedback from the usability tests.
                                                    Most edits were made by adding colors to sections to make information stand out and easy to read.
                                                    Others were spell check and alignment check.</p>

                                                    <h3>WHAT I LEARNED</h3>
                                                    <p>This project was challenging for me.
                                                      I enjoyed the visual design process, however, I had a hard time differentiating my product from the competitors.
                                                      The current market is saturated and I did not want to create another replication of what’s already on the market.
                                                      Competing with a strong competitor like Google Drive was tough. However, I learned to create the product specifically for a targeted audience.
                                                      This significantly helped me plan out my project. If given more time, I would do a preference test and usability test after every iteration.
                                                      I would also perform the tests with more random participants instead of distributing them to mostly the design community.
                                                      I feel that this cause the results to be skewed. </p>
