              <h1>Who are you?</h1>
              <h3>I’m a self-learner, cat advocate,  and food enthusiast.</h3>
              <p>I’m a UI designer with a background in Management Information Systems.
                My background helped me learn to code and nurtured my goal to create user-centered design.
                I like to watch animal rescues in my free time and care for homeless cats in the community.
                My passion to help animals enhance my ability to empathize with user’s needs in every project.</p>

          <li><h1>What's your journey?</h1></li>

          <li><p>My journey started in 2005 when I moved to the U.S.
            I spent most of my time online reading manga and talking to friends as a way to cope with being homesick.
            This started my interest in creating online forumns, finding visual templates, and playing around with the code to customize it.
            You may have guessed it. I loved playing around with mySpace at the time.</p></li>

          <li><img src="/images/discover.jpg" alt="discover"></li><!-- will edit size in css for respondsiveness -->

          <li><p>When I started High School, I decided to take 2 years of web design.
              This turned out to be a disappointment. All we did was learning HTML and Dreamweaver, which had little to no creative aspect.
              I didn’t know CSS existed, so I thought it was the limit of design.</p>

          <li><p>At the end of high school, I remembered running across UI/UX design while researching for a college major.
                It seems at the time, the industry was quite young. There was no degree specified required for it.
                There were limited college classes offered also. At the end, I decided to still submerge myself in the
                technology industry. So, I majored in Management Information Systems.</p>

          <li><p>Post college job hunt was brutal. My head is not in the field I studied.
                  The more I tried to covered up and acted as if I was pursuing my passion, the more miserable I felt.</p>

          <li><p>I realized, I can be broke, but I can’t live happily without doing something I enjoyed.</p>

          <li><img class="img2" src="/images/explain.jpg" alt="discover"> <!-- will edit size in css for respondsiveness -->

          <li><p>So I decided to re-evaluate what I enjoyed most.
                    That’s when I came across UI/UX design again.
                    The industry had grown quite a bit. It’s now easy defined and is vital everywhere.
                    It surprised me how much it could affect our lives.
                    A pretty design is the top of the iceberg.
                    A successful design in one that changes the way people see and experience things.
                    It changes perspectives, it informs, it persuades, and it’s powerful.</p></li>

          <li><p>I realized I’ve always allured to it like a magnet ever since 2006.
                      UI/UX design matches with my interest for creativity, technology, curiosity in our mind and experience.</p></li>

          <li><p>Having the gut to start over and invest myself is my biggest  accomplishment. I
                        t’s a big risk. A good one. I learned a lot and enjoyed what I do;
                        even through the painstaking process, getting out of my comfort zone, and spending hours researching.
                        In short, there is no other I enjoy doing. </p></li>

          <li><p>So here I am, making a difference through design.</p></li>
