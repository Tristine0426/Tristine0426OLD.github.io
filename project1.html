                <h2>PHASE 1: DISCOVERY & RESEARCH</h2>
                 <h3>USER SURVEY</h3>
                  <p>I started the process with a survey to get to know the users and competitors.
                          I wanted to know what kind of information they save, how often,
                          what devices they use to perform these tasks, and specifically, the most important features they use.
                          The goal is to understand what makes them prefer a specific competitor?</p>
                   <p>Here are the results that shaped the foundation of virtBox:</p>

                              This caused confusion. It is a platform known for syncing files from multiple devices rather than for creating new contents.</p>

                    virtBox’s logo combines the letter”B” sideways inside a laptop. The internal “B” is a derivative of earlier sketches of a virtual reality glasses.</p>

           <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
             <p>This project was challenging for me.
                  I enjoyed the visual design process, however, I had a hard time differentiating my product from the competitors.
                  The current market is saturated and I did not want to create another replication of what’s already on the market.
                  Competing with a strong competitor like Google Drive was tough. However, I learned to create the product specifically for a targeted audience.
                  This significantly helped me plan out my project. If given more time, I would do a preference test and usability test after every iteration.
                  I would also perform the tests with more random participants instead of distributing them to mostly the design community.
                  I feel that this cause the results to be skewed. </p>
